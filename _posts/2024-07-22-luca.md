A few weeks ago, on a Tuesday morning around 8:30 am, my son Luca was born. Immediately after seeing him and hearing his first cry, I found myself overwhelmed with emotions that I couldn't explain. I laugh about it now, but I initially feared not having any feelings towards him. Here I am now, bursting with joy at every move he makes, every time he looks at me, and every time I hear him breathe. I can't imagine my life without him.

Life is different now, and it's strange how much it can change. I never thought it could be like this. Waking up whenever he wakes up and sleeping whenever he sleeps has become my new routine. In a way, my whole life has changed. Maybe being a parent is the only job where you know you're going to burn out, but somehow, you find the strength to keep going.

I am happy, and I couldn't be happier. Luca is healthy and beautiful, and he is everything I could have asked for.
