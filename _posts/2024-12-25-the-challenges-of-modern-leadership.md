# The Challenges of Modern Leadership

In my 20 years as a software engineer, I've spent about 5 years in people leadership roles. Along the way, I've had the opportunity to work with many leaders, each with their own unique style. In my experience, leadership styles can be broadly categorized into two main groups: people-first leaders and executive leaders. While individuals often blend aspects of both styles, these two categories represent the extremes of the spectrum.

I’ve had the chance to work with leaders who embody each style to its fullest extent, and I’ve experimented with both in my own leadership journey. Through this article, I hope to share my experiences and insights, particularly for those who aspire to become people leaders or are already navigating leadership roles.

## TL;DR

The people-first leadership is the right way to lead effectively and sustainably.

## People-First Leaders

People-first leaders are, without a doubt, the essence of true leadership. They prioritize their team members in every decision they make, demonstrating a commitment to the well-being and development of their people. Recognizing such leaders might seem straightforward, but it often requires experience and attentiveness to spot them in action.

Some defining traits of people-first leaders include:

- **Putting people first:** They consistently consider the impact of their decisions on individuals and the team before moving forward.
- **Going above and beyond:** They are willing to invest extra effort and resources to support their team members, even when it’s not immediately convenient or expected.

For example, I once worked with a manager who prioritized an employee’s mental health over the deadlines of a project. By arranging flexible working hours and additional support, they not only helped the individual recover but also earned the unwavering loyalty and respect of the entire team. This kind of leadership creates a ripple effect of positivity, fostering trust and collaboration within the team.

## Executive Leaders

In contrast, executive leaders focus primarily on authority and achieving tangible results. While this approach can drive short-term success, it often comes at the expense of long-term team cohesion and growth.

Some typical traits of executive leaders include:

- **Making unilateral decisions:** These leaders often bypass input from the people directly affected by their choices.
- **Authoritarian tendencies:** They lean heavily on their positional power to enforce decisions.
- **Goal-centric focus:** Their emphasis on meeting targets and achieving outcomes often overshadows individual and team needs.
- **Inflexibility:** Pushback or alternative perspectives are rarely entertained.

In my experience, executive leadership might seem effective in environments that reward speed and efficiency. However, this style often overlooks the importance of nurturing the team, which can lead to disengagement and burnout over time. The short-term wins achieved by executive leaders rarely compensate for the long-term costs.

## What's the Catch?

Choosing to be a people-first leader is not easy, especially in modern workplaces that often push leaders toward executive tendencies. Tight deadlines, high expectations, and a relentless focus on metrics can make it tempting to prioritize results over relationships. I've experienced this first hands that many leaders who start as people-first find themselves gradually shifting toward an executive approach, sometimes without even realizing it.

The pressures of modern workplaces can erode people-first principles. Leaders may feel compelled to “make things happen” at the expense of empathy and inclusivity. The emotional labor of people-first leadership can also lead to burnout, making it even harder to stay true to this approach.

## The Case for People-First Leadership

Despite the challenges, I firmly believe that people-first leadership is the right way to lead. It creates an environment where individuals feel valued, supported, and empowered to do their best work. Here’s why:

- **Sustainable success:** Teams led by people-first leaders tend to be more engaged, motivated, and resilient.
- **Stronger relationships:** Prioritizing people fosters trust and loyalty, which are critical for long-term collaboration.
- **Better problem-solving:** Inclusive decision-making brings diverse perspectives, leading to more effective solutions.
- **Positive culture:** A people-first approach sets the tone for a culture of respect and mutual support.

Leadership is not about perfection; it’s about striving to grow while supporting those around you. People-first leadership may require more effort and patience, but its rewards are immeasurable for both leaders and their teams. I hope this article offers valuable insights and inspires you to embrace the people-first approach in your own leadership journey.
